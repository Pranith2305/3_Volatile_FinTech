<h1>Stock News MVP</h1>

 <h2>Problem Statement</h2>

<p>For rookie investors, navigating the stock market can be overwhelming. With a constant flow of stock-related news from various sources like Moneycontrol, Mint, and others, it becomes difficult to filter out the most relevant and easily understandable information. On top of that, new investors often struggle with financial jargon and complex market analysis, making it hard to fully comprehend the news.</p>

 <p>There is also a lack of simplified tools that summarize stock news and provide clear insights on whether the news is positive, negative, or neutral. Rookie investors need an easy way to stay informed, understand market trends, and make decisions without being bogged down by overwhelming data.</p>

 <p>This project aims to create an app that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Scrapes stock market news from trusted platforms.</li>
        <li>Summarizes it into bite-sized, easy-to-understand updates.</li>
        <li>Provides sentiment analysis to help gauge market reactions.</li>
        <li>Integrates a chatbot to assist with stock market terms.</li>
    </ul>

<p>By offering these features, the app will make it easier for beginners to navigate the stock market and make more informed investment choices.</p>
